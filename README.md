# Reproducible-Research-Peer-Graded-Assignment-1
This is my submission for the first peer-graded assignment of the Reproducible Research course of the Data Science Specialization.
I have to note it has been a long time since I last programmed in R (I paused the course for about a year), 
so I am aware I have probably used some very inefficient code.
However, I hope this doesn't affect my grading since I think I have done everything that was asked for.
